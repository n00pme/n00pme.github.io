> I hate the word 'bug'.

In my recognition, the calculator has determinacy.
1 is 1, 0 is 0, there is no second condition.

You want A, but result is B. That's not program's mistake, that's your mistake.

OK, I was just make some complaint for one of my interview, that they asked me whether I met bug when develop a system, that I answered NO, that I say, there is no big problem I met, what I met was how to achieve some function, after I achieve, program runs correct result, you want A, you wrote the code that should output A, it will output A, not ever B, only you are not drown your heart to code, only you do not understand how code works at all, only you are not responsible for your code. 

It is even not need to think that I did not pass that interview. 

So, I hate the word 'bug'.

There is a song called 'who let the dogs out', let me say, there should be a song called 'who let the bugs out' ~
