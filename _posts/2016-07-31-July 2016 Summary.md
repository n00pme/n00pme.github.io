Wow, time passes so fast~

July is complicated.

All kinds of final exam, I spent much time on it. Even in review period, I have a mind that I want to write a book about Information Theory and Coding. Then, it comes out this:

- <a href="https://kyshel.github.io/itc/">itc - online read</a>

Soon, I designed a system called sams.

- <a href="https://github.com/kyshel/sams">sams - see detail code</a>

It means Student Attendance Management System.
Not very difficult, I just make step and imitate partly dms.

In this system, I especilly think about the model,clean,tidy, even MVC mind.

But U think much, the things need to consider are more. U need to spend more time. I also overwhelmed adding too many functions to it.

U will see, page code is little, just threee part:
1. require
2. describe info
3. a function, or two

All the functions, Login,Auth,Data show,and so on, I wrote into one file: functions.php.

It means, each time I open a page, all the functions will load. Seems really fuck!

But, in other condition. I think about en cn words transfer. And I pull the json. Using json file make things clear, simple. U just define en-cn matches, and php show it on pages. It needs a switch to control this translate. I wrote a global constant in config.php.

Summary is over, next is funny stuff in future:
<ul>
 	<li>Node.js</li>
 	<li>Movies</li>
 	<li>~</li>
</ul>
August, I am coming~
